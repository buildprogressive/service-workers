// This is heavily based on Jeremy Keith's minimal viable service worker,
// that you can find here: https://gist.github.com/adactio/3717b7da007a9363ddf21f584aae34af
//
// Things I added:
//  - Lots of comments
//  - Add `install` & `activate` handlers
//  - Support Navigation Preload
//  - Cache HTTP HEAD
//  - Support private Cache-Control response headers
//  - Race the network to avoid slow user experiences on flaky or offline networks
//
// Caching strategy:
//  - HTML requests: prefer the network, fallback to the cache
//  - Other requests: serve from the cache, fallback to the network
//  - Always go to the network in the background to refresh the cache
//
// Caveats:
//  - Your cache will grow bigger and bigger

// The first step in the Service Worker lifecycle is the installation.
addEventListener('install', (e) => {
  // Don't wait for any other connected Service Workers to disconnect
  e.waitUntil(self.skipWaiting());
});

// When the Service Worker is installed, it gets activated.
addEventListener('activate', (e) => {
  // Start controlling all open clients without needing a reload.
  // This makes sure the Service Worker connects with any open browser tabs or windows.
  e.waitUntil(self.clients.claim());

  // Enable navigation preloading.
  // This allows browsers to optimize certain navigation requests
  // when the Service Worker still has to boot
  e.waitUntil(
    (async function() {
      if (self.registration.navigationPreload) {
        await self.registration.navigationPreload.enable();
      }

  );

// Once the Service Worker is activated,
// it has the ability to act on every HTTP request.
addEventListener('fetch', (e) => {
  const { request } = e;
  const { headers, method, url, mode } = request;

  // It's safer to only touch GET & HEAD requests.

      // the full responsibility to the browser.
      const response = fetch(request);

      // Using waitUntil here doesn't mean that the request will only
      // receive its response once this work is done.
      // It marks the Service Worker as busy, and it can only be closed
      // once all waitUntil callbacks are resolved.
      e.waitUntil(

        // to get a fresh response.
        // However, we want to use the Service Worker to provide a good, fast
        // user experience. That's why we can race the network and use the cache
        // to reduce the flakiness of bad networks.
        //
        // This gives us three options:
        // 1. The network responds within 2 seconds, use the fresh response
        // 2. The network hasn't responded within 2 seconds, then:
        // 2.a. If there is a cached version,
        //      return the cached, possibly stale version
        // 2.b. If there is no cached version,
        //      return the pending network request and let the browser handle it
